# Fudomo: Functional Decomposition over Object Models

Fudomo is...
 * A tool -- deployed as a package for the ATOM editor -- that supports example-driven modeling as well as model to text transformations
 * A declarative language for defining model to text transformations
 * A hybrid approach to model transformations based on combining model and code

The Fudomo tool has the following basic functions:
 * Create/modify OYAML object models
 * Infer metamodel from object model
 * Check validity of object model w.r.t. existing metamodel
 * Write model-to-text transformation using the Fudomo language
 * Generate function skeletons in target language (Javascript or Python)
 * Execute transformation on object model and view result
 * Validate transformation w.r.t. code

For a detailed overview as well as installation instructions, please consult the
[Fudomo Tutorial](docs/fudomo-tutorial.pdf).
