# Fudomo: Functional Decomposition over Object Models

Fudomo is a declarative model-to-text transformation language that
uses a hybrid approach, combining model and code.

Tool support for the language is provided by a plugin for the Atom text editor.
It supports the specification and execution of model transformations
through decomposition functions implemented in either JavaScript or Python.

For a detailed overview as well as installation instructions, please consult
the [Fudomo Tutorial](docs/fudomo-tutorial.pdf).
